# HVA24: Mini Hackathon 2.0 - Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of the HVA24 Mini Hackathon 2.0. The aim is to explore India's electric vehicle (EV) market using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis was carried out using a Kaggle notebook with Pandas for data processing and analysis. Power BI was used for visualizing key insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srinrealyf/india-ev-market-data):
1. **EV Maker by Place**: Data on EV manufacturers and their locations.
2. **OperationalPC**: Information on the number of operational charging stations in different states.
3. **Vehicle Class - All**: Data on the number of registrations for various vehicle classes.
4. **ev_cat_01-24**: Data on the number of EVs sold over time across different categories.
5. **ev_sales_by_makers_and_cat_15-24**: Year-wise sales data for EV manufacturers categorized by vehicle types.

## Tools Used
- **Kaggle Notebook**: For executing Python code and performing data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For visualizations to present insights effectively.

## Areas of Analysis

1. **EV Adoption Trends**: The analysis focused on the trends in electric vehicle adoption over the years, helping to identify patterns in the demand for EVs.
   
2. **Manufacturer Performance**: Explored the performance of different EV manufacturers in the market to determine their market share and growth trends.
   
3. **Price vs. Features**: This analysis could not be performed due to insufficient data on EV pricing and related features like battery life, range, and charging time.
   
4. **Impact of Government Policies**: The impact of government policies and subsidies on EV adoption could not be evaluated due to the lack of relevant data in the dataset.
   
5. **Geographical Analysis**: The analysis covered EV adoption rates and the number of charging stations across different regions in India, highlighting which areas are leading in adoption.
   
6. **Environmental Impact**: Due to insufficient data, an analysis of the environmental impact (such as reduction in emissions or fuel consumption) could not be performed.

## How to Access and Run
1. **Kaggle Notebook**: The analysis is done in a Kaggle notebook, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kavyachippada/mini-hackathon2-0).
   
2. **Power BI Visualization**: The visualizations created with Power BI can be accessed via [Power BI report link](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/d5c24f16-a80c-4229-9ac7-aef928a0129f/2e0c4fad9804456584e7?experience=power-bi) or downloaded from this repository.

## Insights and Findings
- **EV Adoption Trends**: There has been a consistent growth in EV adoption, with certain regions in India leading in market share.
- **Manufacturer Performance**: Some manufacturers have captured significant market share, driven by early adoption and technological innovation.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Regions with more charging infrastructure tend to have higher rates of EV adoption.

## Limitations
- **Insufficient Data**: Due to the dataset's limitations, we could not analyze the relationship between EV prices and features, the impact of government policies, or the environmental benefits of EV adoption.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include pricing, feature-specific data, and policy-related information to provide deeper insights.
- Analyze the environmental impact by integrating external datasets on emissions and fuel consumption.
- Explore predictive modeling to forecast future EV adoption trends.

## Conclusion
This project provided an analysis of India's electric vehicle market, with a focus on adoption trends, manufacturer performance, and geographical insights. Despite some data limitations, the findings offer valuable insights into the factors shaping the EV industry's growth in India.
